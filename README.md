## Goal
Sending navigational points-of-interest from the passengers of a car to the drive is not seamless. Most apps like Google Maps, Yelp, and TripAdviser have a "share" option. This is usually shared through a texting app to the driver. This still requires the driver to open the text messages, read the text, tap a link, confirm the navigation app to load, then start navigation. This is too much interaction to perform safely while driving. The goal of this app is to streamline that. First by making a consistent place to send POI from passengers to the driver. Second, by allow these messages to be opened automatically on the driver’s phone with minimal interaction.
